# 8BIT-PY
Just messing around with simulating low-level computer stuff (like a 1Hz clock) using Python. Basically trying to get a better feel for how computers actually work under the hood, even though I'm using a high-level language. Playing with lower-level concepts in a higher-level environment â€” more of a freestyle experiment than anything super formal.
